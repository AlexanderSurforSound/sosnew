The sun is always shining on this beautiful home on the oceanfront in Rodanthe with easy access to the beach and the ocean waves. You can't get much closer to the beach than this! And don't let the party wane in the afternoon, continue the celebration at the large pool with expanded entertainment area around the pool, under the house and on the oceanside. Enjoy the Tiki bar with built-in gas grill and nearby picnic tables to spread out the snacks and enjoy your meal by the sea. Next to the Tiki bar you'll find an outdoor shower and a separate room with full size refrigerator and cabana half bath. Step inside the home and you'll be greeted by an inviting southwest decor featuring natural wood, leather furnishings and adobe-style architectural features. The first level of the home offers more entertainment in the game room with pool table, TV/DVD and wet bar with full size refrigerator. Also on this level are five relaxing bedrooms: two master bedrooms, a king and a queen, have private full baths; a queen bedroom with TV/DVD and 2 bedrooms with a pyramid bunk and single bed and TV/DVDs in each share the hall bath with the game room. Find two more king master bedrooms on the second level of the home, each with TV/DVD. The great room boasts high vaulted ceilings, luxurious southwestern furnishings, a large flat screen TV with DVD player and a spread of windows bathing the room in warm light and offering blue ocean views. The bright kitchen has lots of counter space and a breakfast bar for mealtime conversations and extra seating, but it's doubtful that you will need it with the dining table that seats more than 20 people. Step out onto the two levels of oceanfront decks to enjoy your morning coffee, after dinner drinks or simply to kick back and relax with the sound of the waves crashing on the shore.

From the expansive decks that flank both east and west sides of this statuesque oceanfront home, you can choose to watch the ocean waves roll-in or the sun sink into the beautiful Pamlico Sound. Upon arrival, unpack into the convenient all-level elevator, change into your suits and dive into the refreshing private pool or relax in the nearby hot tub. Beach access is quick and easy over the walkway and a half bath is available just off the pool deck for quick trips in from the pool or beach. The first level game room provides hours of indoor entertainment with pool table, foosball and a flat screen TV. A kitchenette with refrigerator and microwave make it easy to grab a drink or heat up a snack. For evening wind-down kick back and watch a movie in the media room with large screen home theater system. Also nearby is an exercise room to keep your routine intact. The kids can bunk down in the bedroom on this level with 3 sets of bunks and a private full bath. Another full bath and the laundry room round out this level. The mid-level of the home features four king master suites, each with private bath, tile shower and flat screen TV. Relax in the sitting area with beautiful views of the ocean or sound, comfortable seating, a table for board games and a desk for some indoor surfing.

Located in the prestigious Hatteras Landing neighborhood on the very southern tip of Hatteras Island, your family will not only lavish in the peaceful isolation on the beaches, but will also appreciate the benefit of walking across the street to a marina, the ferry dock and a selection of shops and eateries. Hatteras Village is not your typical Outer Banks beach town. This quaint village provides plenty of down-home charm while also providing an array of respected galleries, gift shops, coffee shops, restaurants, marinas, and the Hatteras Island library just a bike ride up the road. DIAMOND SHOALS connects to the community walkway which provides easy and safe access throughout the area. For the anglers in the group, Hatteras Village is home to the island's famous charter fishing fleet. The nearby offshore Gulf Stream waters offer great fishing. If you have your own boat, two marinas are within walking distance from the home and offer slips for rent. Of course, surfers, kite boarders, windsurfers, paddle boarders and beachgoers all find the conditions on the island to be the best on the East Coast. DIAMOND SHOALS is a jewel.
